# gaia_xmatch
A simple Jupyter notebook to help with GAIA DR2 cross-matches. Our example uses pulsar positions in the IPTA DR1 to cross-match with GAIA DR2.
Our paper is in preparation, but please feel free to use our cross-match technqiue for your own GAIA explorations!
Please cite Mingarelli, Anderson, Bedell, and Spergel (in prep) if you use this.
